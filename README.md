# Voice Translation with ASR and TTS
## Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following:
1. Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) installed and configured with proper credentials for both the ASR and TTS services.
## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install google-cloud-speech google-cloud-texttospeech
  ```
3. Replace the following placeholders in the script with your actual input and settings:
   - `input_audio_file`: The path to your input audio file in English.
   - `your_translation_function`: Replace this with your preferred translation method or API for translation between languages.
   - `output_audio_file`: The path where you want to save the translated audio file.
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python voice_translation.py
   ```
5. The script will transcribe the input audio, translate the transcribed text, synthesize the translated text into speech, and save the output audio in the target language.
